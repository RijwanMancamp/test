- The topic of today's discussion is whether it is better to study online or in a regular - classroom. -###  You will have a chance to hear a discussion by native English speakers on this topic,
- and pay attention to any special expressions and phrases they - use. -###  After the discussion,
- we will go over the expressions and phrases - used. -###  Today,
- I have some special friends who agreed to help me with this discussion, and they are reading in the classroom next - door. - It is true that if you'### re going to study online,
- you can study faster than in a regular classroom, but a teacher can motivate students and provide quality resources in a regular classroom - setting. -###  When you are expressing your opinion,
- you can say "I think" or "in my opinion".
-###  If you want to contradict what someone else has said,
- you can say "but" or "however".
- A good way to show that you recognise the contribution that someone else has made to the discussion is to say "That's a good point".
-###  If you want to add your own opinion,
- you can say "I'd like to add" or "I'd also like to say".
-###  If someone is trying to interrupt you,
- you can say "Please let me finish".
-###  To summarise the discussion,
- you can say "In conclusion" or "In a nutshell".
- A nice way to end the discussion is to say "Can we summarise the discussion?" or "I hope this lesson has given you a number of different questions that you can use when you're taking part in a discussion."
