######  The discussion
Today,
- I have some special friends who agreed to help me with this lesson.###  They are reading in the classroom next door,
- so that they have them that'### s true,
- but if you'### re going to study online,
- as I was saying,###  is used when you are which running to your to speaking to whatever you would say when someone has interrupted you ok,
- ok, I am talking again.### 
Next,
- please let me finish is a very nice way to hold the floor in a - discussion. It means to establish your position as the speaker right to someone else is trying to interrupt you want a chance to finish what you are saying so you say please let me finish.### 
Ok,
- true,###  but if you studying online,
- as I was saying,###  is used when you are which running to your to speaking to whatever you would say when someone has interrupted you ok,
- ok, I am talking again.### 
Next,
- don't get me wrong is an expression that we use when we want to contradict what someone else has said when we disagree with what someone else has - said. A good point that I'### d also like to add is that it shows that you recognise the contribution that someone else has made to the discussion,
- and you are also going to add your own opinion, which is different from what the first person - said. If you'### re sorry,
- but which one is something which changes that are two different ways in which you can enter where it is casual,###  it is at the first one was perfectly done,
- for you know, in Africa live show you how not to do it and James may I say what is the right way to enter a discussion.### 
Next,
- in conclusion,###  in a nutshell,
- this means in short me some up by saying, "### Henry,
- some art means can we summarise the that'### s a nice way to end the discussion by including everyone in it,
- it'### s not as if one person is deciding to end the discussion,
- is asking everyone permission by saying can we submit by saying I hope this lesson has given you a number of different questions that you can use when you're taking part in a discussion."
